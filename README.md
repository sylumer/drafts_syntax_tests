# Drafts Syntax Tests
A set of content that can be used for testing a variety of syntaxes in the Drafts app (visit getdrafts.com).

Each item tries to cover as many variations in the syntax as seems reasonable.  This is based on best endeavours, and so is not a guarantee that it will necessarily cover absolutely everything.

Each file is provided as a plain text file within the repository.

- **GitHub Markdown**
- **JavaScript**
- **Markdown**
- **MultiMarkdown**
